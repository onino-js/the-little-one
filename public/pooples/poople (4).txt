CAN YOU?

Can you look beyond the things you see?
Through the eyes not with the eyes?
Can you glimpse the person you can be?
And grasp the truth beyond the lies?

Can you leave the past and embrace the now?
Taking charge of your space and time?
Can you move ahead and take a vow
To let go and make the climb?

Can you accept yourself the way you are?
Align yourself with the universe.
Can you see your beauty from afar?
With paint and brush, you create your verse.

Can you rise above sensations and emotions?
Be detached yet still attached?
Can you be wild yet calm like the oceans?
Respond to life and become unmatched.

I can be. Yes, I can be.
I can rise beyond my past and live.
I can be. Yes, I can be.
I can be whatever I believe.
