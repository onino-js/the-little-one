I’m the voice of the voices
I’m the eye of the eagle owl
Whatever it means, one thing is for true
I don’t believe in god nor in goddess who lies in my heart
I only trust in me and in self destruction
Because I’m the greatest rebelle of all time
People fear me as long as I live forever
The strongest of them tried to stab me in front and back
The only thing they win: humiliation and so on
An opponent stronger than even; ever immortal
The nation of earth don’t care about race
We must have no time to play around, did you know our winter is harsh ?
That might our solution and not your big big problem
An small issue in the pyramid foot, the great two towers Eye
Two bad for you my friend my only weapon is a needle
A cheap one but as you may learn it can arm
Cheap and good quality is nothing miracle in the land of bears
You may have several nation against me and our brothers
I may have several bodies to back me and our sisters
You may think I’m an heartless pussy
You might think my people is not behind me
You MIGHT learn my people is my just my people
I don’t give them orders at the end I’m not that lazy
You could discover that we may destroy ourselves to make it quick 
Painful yes but for the sake of humanity
The bravest of all knight only fight for lovers
the USSR may died in the most humiliating way
But the red army chorus will raise again the banners
And we will win the fight with our weapon we have since we were born
I know you think the exactitude and morality
Only lies in freedom and your own balls…
So let’s make it crystal clear just for you once for all!
My poor friend you were a little too arrogant to noticed
Our nuclear A weapons is our spirit as Nation and that’s fair enough
Music, illustration, poetry, and so much you don’t even take time to watch
Our TSAR BOMBA is and will always be the bigger one
Our biochemic weapon lies in a heart you can't feel
Sorry for my english this language is so poor
I may hurt people inadvertently..
Sorry for my french.. Wo knows…?
May you learn Cyrilic alphabet and know what you are talking about
For the sake and piece of humanity
Period
