HELLO NATURE

Hello, Nature. Can I tell them? Can I whisper to their ears?
All your words echoed in silence that they seldom even hear.
You're the beauty that surrounds us, you're the greatest piece of art.
In your leaves are hidden mysteries, long before we had a start.
How beautiful you are, when oceans dance under the waves.
Oh! How majestic you are, when the mountains tell your tales.

Hello, Nature. Can I tell them? Can I sing your praise all day?
Till the stars blanket the night and the skies are patched with gray.
Till the lions give their roar and their cubs run to the call.
Till my yonder is all gone and my heart cannot recall.
And even though we always hurt you, you forgive and always give.
You're the calmness that we breathe and without you, can we live
