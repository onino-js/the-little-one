Once upon a turtoise

All I need is one
One turtoise is enough
Baby you got it wrong
Please turn your soul into folks

We are collusion, melody contracted
The mind of a young boy far a west

We are fusion, melody repeated…
ClEO has fever and we turn in his head

We are a union, melody weighted !
Devs ahead and the songs of sirens

We are completion, melody blended
By the nil being highlighted

"Four living pillars that often lie."
"On top of the turtoise galactic ride."
"Holy bath in the dessert you may find"

Witch is conspiration, melody hacked
Might us know everything. Solution for the rest

We are misconception, you are the problem
Simple malady that digs in our heads

Let’s break this chain, make it an ex dote
I beg you join we in the Barbapapote

We're just melody and only you got

May you find your turtoise and go through the extreme
Gods will your sacrifice it might be rewarded

Just for the livings and living for the justs
Prettiest of the meme to misleading emblem
You will be good enough will be the Farce
