The strengh in unity

When darkness comes,
warriors are born
In the Advent of war,
a new light shines.
There are those who will stand.
For they have sworn.
To defend the weak against
those who cross the lines.

When darkness seems
to have won.
An alliance is formed
To stand as one.
For when strength fails
Unity prevails.
From an unexpected twist
A new tale.

Now, when the battle is won.
And evil is forgiven.
Recognizing the power
Of evil's might.
For love must prevail
Another chance is given
But we'll never forget.
Darkness isn't light.
