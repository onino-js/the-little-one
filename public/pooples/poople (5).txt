I HAD A DREAM

A dream is our soul's voice from within.
A silent whisper of our deepest thoughts.
In the silence of my long and heavy breaths.
I had a dream ,a stroll into my future's home.

Awoken from the most beautiful dream.
A new light, shining from within.
So bright, they could hardly see.
The new me, determined to win.

Oh! I have climbed this valley for too long.
Like an endless maze, turning in circles.
I press and push, from dusk till dawn;
but the chains of my mind hold me down.

They laugh aloud and make fun of me,
They jeer at me and make poor jokes.
I smile and march on, they are just but a chapter in my book.
Soon, their words will be a step too distant.

Life is a mirror, a reflection of your thoughts,
and fear is the stone, set for a mighty crash.
Break away through courage and will.
Mix all the colors, you are your life's own artist.

I took the dare, I threw my coin.
With faith and hope, I still march on.
And whoever asked, I simply say,
I had a dream, a stroll into my future's home.
