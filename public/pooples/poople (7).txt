Songs of pain

Kehinde ti ku!!
The green-eyed owl laughs aloud.
Hanging steadily from the great Iroko tree,
It watches all through the night,

The skies pour out tears of grief.
For the green-eyed owl has not moved an inch.
Papa's head; wrapped between his arms.
Oblivious of the great distress resting beneath the mango tree.

Ah! Taiwo ti ku oooo!!
Taiwo ti ku!!!
The green-eyed owl has not moved an inch.
All the birds have fled from Iya Ibeji's screams.
Even dry bones underneath have their hands on their ears.

Papa's thoughts trails back to seven years ago
When the deal was struck, and judgment passed.
Ah! Baba Alaka has long passed away.
Esu has finally come to fulfill the bargain.
For he always takes more than he gives.

Ah! Taye ti ku ooo!!
Taye ti ku!!!
Rivers of blood are running still.
Papa's hysteric laughter has gotten out of hand
For he has begun an eternal conversation with spirits yet unknown.

Ah! Sing it across the length and breath of Egba,
Ah! Let the town crier's voice be heard oo.
Ah! Esu has taken more than he gave oo.
The seed of impatience never grows ripe.

Ha! Eledumare stares at the vanity of man.
Even the birds sing of the vanity of man.
Ha! I hear great songs of pain.
If only all could trust in Olodumare's word.
For him alone gives life for all to live.
