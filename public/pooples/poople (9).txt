Far a west

You came far from england to enslave my brothers
You need unique hand to be less oblivion
The bravest of all knights only fight for others
You'll never get lights staring at your dungeon
You have a nice sword might I have a hammer
You can break my body not my resolution
Volitional sacrifice dignified manners
I'll take you by back with my mighty dragon
You got to the bottom when I raised the banners
You'll have little time may you find the pardon
